Player controls
Arrow and "wasd" keys should move CupHead and change his facing direction.

The 'z' and 'n' key should cause CupHead to attack using his handgun.

Number keys (1, 2, 3, 4, 5.) should be used to have CupHead switch to a different projectile type. Use n or z to see new pattern.

Use 'e' to cause CupHead to become damaged.

Block/obstacle controls
Use keys "t" and "y" to cycle between which block is currently being shown (i.e. think of the obstacles as being in a list where the game's current obstacle is being drawn, "t" switches to the previous item and "y" switches to the next)

Item controls
Use keys "u" and "i" to cycle between which item is currently being shown (i.e. think of the items as being in a list where the game's current item is being drawn, "u" switches to the previous item and "i" switches to the next)

Enemy/NPC (other character) controls
Use keys "o" and "p" to cycle between which enemy or npc is currently being shown (i.e. think of these characters as being in a list where the game's current character is being drawn, "o" switches to the previous item and "p" switches to the next)
characters should move, animate, fire projectiles, etc. as they do in the final game, but should not interact with any other objects

Other controls
Use 'q' to quit and 'r' to reset the program back to its initial state
